# Titanic Dataset Analysis
# Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and machine learning. It is often used as a beginner's dataset for practicing data analysis and predictive modeling. The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg.

The dataset includes various features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket fare, cabin number, and whether the passenger survived or not. The goal of analyzing this dataset is often to gain insights into the factors that influenced the survival of passengers.
